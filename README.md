# Open-Sports-Data-NFL

This project is to provide the public with open-source sports data and a way to use that data in some analyses to get a deeper understanding of Data Science. 

In this project, I aim to improve my data analytic skills while showing people how easy it is to view data interestingly. Some future considerations I will be keeping in mind are: 
 - Eventually, I would like to take this data to a website to improve usability for people that don't have coding skills. 
 - Use several different modelling algorithms utilizing standard machine learning and neural networks. But to also   see if I can create my own.
- Make this enjoyable for the everyday person who might not have (or wish to have) a deep understanding of Data   Science, but, would like to improve how they understand sports stats. However, I don't want to make this too rudimentary so people interested in Data Science cannot glean information from this project. 


As the title suggests, all data (including codes) are open source and feel free to use. Due to the nature of modelling sports data, I do not condone gambling with the data or models uploaded now, or in the future.
